Fundamentals of node.js
Lesson 1 1
  Node.js was created back in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. His motivation was to create a platform that allows developers to use JavaScript for both clients and server-side development hence unifying programming experience. With invention of node.js, JavaScript could run on server-side because node.js is built on top og Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js also introduced an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model making it perfect for building fast, scalable application more so those that handle real-time, high traffic applications like collaborative tools.
  
  UES OF NODE.JS
  It is used to build applications that require real-time communications. This is due to its event-driven nature
  It is used in streaming application like Netflix because node.js streams data in large volumes.
  Node.js is used to build RESTfu APIs for web and mobile. Frameworks like Express allows for connection of back-end services to front-end frameworks.
  It is used to build microservices by breaking large application into manageable smaller services. 

  IMPORTANCE OF NODE.JS
  A unified language for full-stack development as it allows developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end.
  High performance and scalability due to it being built on V8 engine and optimized for asynchronous operations. Therefore, it can handle large numbers of concurrent operations.
  Node.js offers a vast package ecosystem hosted on NPM. These prebuilt libraries and tools accelerates development and enhances functionality.
  Its asunchronous and event-driven nature makes it perfect for building applications that require real-time communications.
  Node.js  has an active communityand extensive cooperate support.

Lesson 2
  Installation of node.js involves downloading node.js installer from the official website
  To intialize a project, go to the project directory in your VS code and open a terminal. In the teminal, type 'npm innit -y' and press enter. This will intialize your project and download the necessary dependencies which are stored in package.json file.
